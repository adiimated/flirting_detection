931,0,I hope too. I'm sure it's exactly that down the line.
932,0,How was your day?
933,0,That sounds wonderful! I can relate to the parts about sleep and being tired afterwards. Proof that your brain was utilized for something new!

954,0,how is your weekend going?
955,0,"Own a musket for home defense, since that's what the founding fathers intended. Four ruffians break into my house. ""What the devil?"" As I grab my powdered wig and Kentucky rifle. Blow a golf ball sized hole through the first man, he's dead on the spot. Draw my pistol on the second man, miss him entirely because it's smoothbore and nails the neighbors dog. I have to resort to the cannon mounted at the top of the stairs loaded with grape shot, ""Tally ho lads"" the grape shot shreds two men in the blast, the sound and extra shrapnel set off car alarms. Fix bayonet and charge the last terrified rapscallion. He Bleeds out waiting on the police to arrive since triangular bayonet wounds are impossible to stitch up. Just as the founding fathers intended."
956,0,"You may not believe me, but I am respecting you right now, as we speak."
957,0,"Oh no, what sorts of messages are you getting?"

985,0,"I stay away from gluten, all animal products except ground beef"
986,0,Mostly stay away from soy
987,0,I went vegan for ethical reasons. Cows (especially pasture raised) live substantially better lives than other animals and produce far more meat per animal so I am reasonably comfortable eating it (the alternative is that they dont live at all). My health was pretty bad for a bit so I decided to try introducing some kind of meat and beef was the best option. Dont know if it helped or not
988,0,Only ground because it's cheap hahaha
989,0,I suspect the same thing with me regarding gluten. I tested negative for celiac but get really fatigurd when I eat bread

1007,0,Went to college in Providence... so I guess I'm coming from a lot of places
1008,0,Cant say I've ever met someone who's been to Rhode Island but not New York hahahaha. Are you going to school in Oakland too or just at home right now?
1009,0,"Yeah new york city is something you have to experience. There is really nowhere like it, at least in America. I would never want to live in there but it's fun for like two days hahaha"
1010,0,"I live in Berkeley on mlk way, by ohlone park. I was actually between oakland and Berkeley when I was looking for somewhere to live but ended up here."
1011,0,I've heard oakland really cool though
1012,0,No worries I usually have them off too so I spend less time on this app hahaha
1013,0,What sort of stuff do you like to do in Berkeley? With the quarantine and all I havent had much chance to explore
1014,0,I suck at smash but what makes you think you stand a chance at jeopardy
1015,0,Hahaha damn it you got with me the or. Either way I was bluffing you would probably wack me at both.
1016,0,Are you a professional soccer coach?
1017,0,That's a dope job. I was a grader in college which was an extremely exciting way to make 10 dollars an hour
1018,0,"I'm assuming you are at Berkeley, what are you studying?"
1019,0,"Psychology is really cool, are you gonna be a therapist or just doing it cause it's cool? Are you psychoanalyzing me as we speak"
1020,0,"A combination of factors. I'm part of a couple communities that are centered here, it's good for.my line of work (software), the weather is great, and I wanted to try something new after spending my whole life in the northeast"
1021,1,Dope so if we get married I can get free drugs in 10 years
1022,0,I grew up in new york state in a town called Mamaroneck. Then my mom and I moved to Mass when I was in college and moved around there a bit.
1023,0,I actually had never been to Ca before moving here. But I've liked it a lot so far minus the air quality
1024,0,I have like no sense of smell so I only notice when I start coughing
1025,0,Are you from CA?
1026,0,"I miss the east coast a bit, especially the part where I paid 500 dollars a month in rent. Why a year in New Orleans - did you go somewhere else and then transfer? I would last like 2 days (ambitious estimate) in that climate before leaving so kudos to you for lasting so long"
1027,0,"Believe it or not you are not the first Tulaner I've met on tinder haha. What I've heard about it corroborates what you said, my friend there goes three times a week despite coronavirus."
1028,0,Are you big into partying?
1029,0,Goes out *
1030,0,"Same as you. Partied a decent amount in high school and early college, then for whatever reason being drunk didnt feel good anymore so that pretty much was it for me.  Was never going out 3 times a week tho haha I would literally die"
1031,0,You ever do some crazy shit while drunk
1032,0,That bad huh?
1033,0,Now I'm curious
1034,0,Might as well get all the embarrassing stuff out then it's all uphill from here
1035,0,"Haha those are the important ones. But I also have a bunch of random interests. I like running and hiking, intellectual stuff generally like reading, coding, reality TV, political gambling recently, video games"
1036,0,What are you into besides jeopardy and smash?
1037,0,Also I just saw your 5th photo for the first time and it made me laugh really hard
1038,1,I bet all your pictures do well with dudes 😎
1039,0,I was a neuroscience major for one semester! Really cool stuff
1040,0,Do you play soccer at Cal?
1041,0,That's real smart. I've seen people really change after multiple concussions so I'm not letting my kids play football haha. How did it inspire your interest in neuroscience?
1042,0,Oh man migraines are the worst. I had them pretty bad for a couple years. How often do you get them?
1043,0,You should try magnesium and vitamin B2 if you haven't already. There is some decent research suggesting that they help
1044,0,"CoQ 10 too if I remember correctly. Ironically my migraines ended up being caused by a magnesium supplement I took, and it was months before I found the connection because it didnt make any sense."
1045,0,"I appreciate you asking. In general, not a really serious relationship (I spent most of college in one so I need some time off), but I guess you never know. Beyond that I'm pretty flexible in terms of what I'm looking for. With Corona things are bit weird. My house is really strict about social distancing, and the majority agreed on being this risk averse so I gotta respect it. Which makes things a bit challenging at least in the next couple months before we get this allegedly 90 percent effective vaccine."
1046,0,How about you?
1047,0,"I guess to be more succinct, generally I'm looking for somewhere between  friends with benefits and semi serious fling"
1048,1,Currently looking more for friends with sexual tension hahaha
1049,0,"Haha it doesn't to me. I'd say I'm not looking for a relationship, but am looking for some level of connection beyond hooking up and nothing else. Have you met many dudes off tinder or no?"
1050,0,"I have met up with only two I think. The first girl was pretty cool, but our first date was a few days before we got off for winter break so that didn't continue. Then I had a fling with another girl who was pretty cool (the tulaner). Another girl who I had seen around campus and was really into asked me out on tinder and then flaked in a pretty shitty way."
1051,0,So tinder has been like mildly fruitful haha
1052,0,Probably not worth the countless hours I have wasted swiping
1053,0,Hahaha this is over the course of like a year
1054,0,"She asked me out, I gave a time like 9 or 10 days out. She did not respond until the night before when I was in NC for a job interview and asked me if I was still good for the date. And when I tried to reschedule she got pissed off. It was truly baffling"
1055,0,Bullet dodged though
1056,0,This is super unrelated but I'm curious how you spend your days with covid
1057,0,I feel like my entire day kind of blends together cause I have nowhere to be and before I know it a full day has passed and it's not clear what I've really done
1058,0,"Hahaha was the frat your only option? I would probably take anything over a frat. I lived in a sorority my sophomore year which was great, both for meeting girls and living in a clean and peaceful space."
1059,0,What classes are you in right now?
1060,0,I see. Is it an off campus frat house? Judging by my rent this might be the one part of the country where I'd guess that dorms are cheaper than off campus
1061,0,What have you learned in your biological clocks class? I cant seem to get my circadian rhythm in check. Always feel tired when I want to be awake and vice versa
1062,0,Okay what the fuck that is absurd. Our student housing was like 800 a month and that was enough to elicit my indignation. 2200 a month seems like probably not that far off tuition right?
1063,0,I do not buy that taking melatonin is useless. I took it for a while and it was too effective. Knocked me straight out but then I'd feel really off the next day
1064,0,Maybe I have a melatonin deficiency...
1065,0,Yeah that's absurd. I guess they can get away with it cause the area is so expensive.
1066,0,You doing anything interesting this weekend?
1067,1,"Hey Sammy, you have a great smile!"
1068,0,How is your life going right now 1-10 hit me with it
1069,1,"Hey Madelyn, you have a great smile!"
1070,0,What sort of art do you do?
1071,0,It does not but now I am concerned why you think it does. Are there signs?!?!??!
1072,0,I am just kidding I have a long and colorful family history of early onset balding and according to 23 and me I have every genetic risk factor
1073,0,Thankfully I have a beautifully shaped head so I look forward to those days
1074,0,In what ways have you been screwed by genetics
1075,1,I have a fat ass too believe it or not. What if we had a kid
1076,1,So will we conceive in your 2003 subaru or mine
1077,0,Hey Grace what's up?
1078,0,Can you tell me what FDT stands for I have been trying to figure this out for like 3 minutes and I'm dying to know
1079,0,"Disappointed in myself for not figuring that out.  Share the sentiment though, the election was a huge relief though I wish it wasn't as close as it was"
1080,0,If you had a bio what would it say
1081,0,"I live in fear of the mf groove, but I always appreciate a reminder"
1082,0,How is life going for you Ansley? 1-10
1083,1,"I am experienced in fish rearing, so would like to apply to coparent your fish. What is their name?"
1084,1,Are you still hiring for this role
1085,1,Dream date idea: zoom date except my internet doesnt cut out like it did last time
1086,1,"Your really cute Jessica, you're smile is very pretty!"
1087,0,Ava how is ur life going right now 1-10 hit me w it
1088,0,Natasha hows ur life going -10 to 10 hit me w it
1089,0,Not too bad. Whats your secret to staying above 0 in these trying times
1090,0,On a scale of 1 to 10 how well is your life going right now
1091,1,Damn girl I wish I was your student
1092,0,What are you teaching?
1093,0,What sort of reality TV show do you hope to be on?
1094,0,"What if I dont have a car, but I can type 135 WPM. Do I still make the cut or nah"
1095,1,I am so excited to finally have someone who I can brag about this to
1096,0,I think it runs in my family - my mom is also an absurdly fast typer. Doesnt hurt that I also played piano for most of my life and spend an inordinate amount of time on my computer.
1097,0,Hows life going for you in the quarantine?
1098,0,"Haha there are probably some finger related genes somewhere in the genome. What style of piano did you play? I mostly played classical, I liked jazz but sucked at it"
1099,0,"I'd say same as you. There are some things I appreciate like being able to work from home, but it is pretty boring. My house has 16 people so we are really strict with covid risk cause if one person gets it we are all fucked. Hiking and running are pretty much the only things I do outside the house"
1100,1,Soilmates?
1101,0,I'm pretty surprised I got it. I was fully prepared to spend like 15 minutes figuring it out haha
1102,0,How how has your day been?
1103,1,"Ilana, I understand it can be I intimidating to talk to someone as attractive as myself but I am not sure how we can figure out if we are soilmates if we dont speak."
1104,0,I was so excited for 30 seconds until I realized you were 50 miles away hahahaha
1105,0,"I'm in Berkeley, just moved here from the east coast"
1106,0,I dont even know what's 50 miles away is that the desert or something
1107,0,Okay maybe we cant date but you CAN educate me
1108,0,What else can you teach me about this great state?
1109,0,I like it a lot here! Weather is insanely good (on days when you can breathe without damaging lungs). Other than that I havent really been able to experience much because of the coronavirus and the fact that I am too lazy to do stuff.
1110,0,"On a scale of 1 to 10, how well is your life going right now?"
1111,0,Ah jeez I'm a bit late to respond to this
1112,0,How much spaghetti do I have to cook you to make up for it
1113,0,Hey Vivien! I too am new to Berkeley - what brings you here?
1114,0,I just moved here a couple of months ago for work. I graduated back in May. What are you studying?
1115,0,"Are you named after the water bottle brand, or is it named after you???"
1116,0,Damn I'm impressed. What makes you so great as to have an entire brand named after you?
1117,0,Do you get a cut of the profits?
1118,0,So nice to meet you Yanny

1122,0,The magnitude of the coincidence has to be some sort of sign
1123,1,How much parks and rec is too much?
1124,0,I have been told I would line parks and rec but am scared that the same thing is going to happen to me
1125,0,People told me to watch the office and then all of the sudden two weeks have gone by and I've done nothing else
1126,0,Office does too much cringe humor but I also love the characters so it balances out
1127,0,Are you still playing violin/doing other music stuff?
1128,0,We were a baller duet we sounded so good
1129,0,"Hahaha no worries this was a really long time ago, I accompanied you for a couple concerts, was a cool experience cause I almost always played solo"
1130,0,Are you planning on doing music long term or something else?
1131,0,Yeah it was just on violin IIRC. I think Steve tried to put me into situations where I'd be around girls
1132,0,"Mad respect for wanting to go into government, I dont think I'd last a day"
1133,0,I can barely read about politics without getying angry
1134,0,"Finally, my suspicion has been confirmed"
1135,0,Jokes on him I had no idea at the time
1136,0,What sort of government stuff are you interested in?
1137,0,I'd vote for you

1141,0,Ended up having to go at least 3 times
1142,0,How have you been spending your quarantine besides parks and rec?
1143,0,Please dont be a bot

1183,0,"4.94 is an impressive score, but does it keep you up at night wondering who the uber driver was who gave you less than 5 stars, ruining what could have been a perfect score?"
1184,0,Still curious about this
1185,1,I already see a lot of compatibility here
1186,0,I love making spaghetti
1187,0,Salutations mam
1188,0,Are you enjoying the quarantine
1189,0,"Haha understandable, good time to kick a caffeine habit though. Getting pretty depressed from lack of social contact. Trying to stay productive though and apply for jobs so I'm not sad and also unemployed."

1244,0,I have extra respect for women who message first

1273,0,It's extremely important for dental health
1274,0,I see why you might think that
1275,0,But think about it this way:
1276,0,"If everybody flossed, their teeth would be healthier. Therefore, there would be less of a need for dental surgery, and dentists would lose money"
1277,0,Point is we should go on a date so I can teach you how to floss

1322,0,"I think I can work with that, but where will we park the horses we take to work?"

2462,0,i'd love to do surgery
